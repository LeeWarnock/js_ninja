# Rob's Main Idea Write up from Slack

The game will be a top-down camera game similar to Pokemon or most RPG video games

).

The main character is a JavaScript Ninja, kind of supposed to be mocking how many job descriptions out there try and be cool and say they’re looking to hire a Javascript ninja, or javascript unicorn, javscript warlord, etc (yes I’ve really seen all these used).  One day he’ reading the paper and sees a job opening for a javascript ninja and gets an interview.

The game itself is his interview process.  As he walks through the office building, he gets stopped by multiple employees along the way who test his javascript knowledge.  Each one turns into a mini battle where they ask a question and if he gets it right he does damage to the employee, if he’s wrong he takes damage.

After getting passed all the standard employees, he has to talk to the team lead or hiring manager or something, where it’s kind of like a boss fight with the same battle structure, but tougher questions.  And that’s kinda how I imagine each level working.

As for level design I was thinking an office building built out of 8-bit tiles that kind of pokes fun at your ‘stereotypical’ start up company.  Instead of only walls, the office he walks through also will also be ful of beer kegs, desks, macbooks, ping pong tables, etc.

And the main character I’m thinking should be an actual 8-bit ninja drawing, and everyone else in the game normal businees people.
