# Ideas	and Questions


### Maps/Assets
8 Bit, and in color.

##### Map
Going to design a proof of concept map in tiled

Map should be a large, scrolling map.  i.e. camera should follow player.  Game Field is 800x600 at the moment, so map should be at least double that, probably larger even.

##### Characters/assets
1 main character - Ninja Skin
2-5 NPCs
1-3 Villain skins

Eakin - I am going to attempt to build the map/characters around 64px squares. Large enough for big screens, small enough for little ones.


### Game Structure
RPG like
Pokemon and FF elements



### Combat System

Eakin - How do fights happen?
Eakin - Do we want items?
Eakin - What do we want the fight structure to be? Is it Turn-based?
	HP, AP, Def, Speed?
